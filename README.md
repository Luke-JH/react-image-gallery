# React Image Gallery

Welcome to my new Next.js/React.js image gallery :)
Please feel free to use it as inspiration for your personal projects

## CI/CD - Vercel Integration

This project is setup to deploy code from the `main` branch, to Vercel via GitHub Actions.
The config file can be found in the `.github/workflows` directory.

## Switch out the stock images for whichever ones you would like to use

They can be found in the public directory

## Replace image links in `app/GalleryGrid.tsx` with links to your new images

Try to find time to add some alt text for screen readers too :)

## Run local server

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Build for prod

```bash
npm run build
```

Thanks for using the image gallery, I hope you found it useful!
